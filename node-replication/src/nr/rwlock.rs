//! The distributed readers-writer lock used by the replica.
//!
//! This module is only public since it needs to be exposed to the benchmarking
//! code. For clients there is no need to rely on this directly, as the RwLock
//! is embedded inside the Replica.
//!
//! # Testing with loom
//!
//! We're not using loom in this module because we use UnsafeCell and loom's
//! UnsafeCell exposes a different API. Luckily, loom provides it's own RwLock
//! implementation which (with some modifications, see `loom_rwlock.rs`) we can
//! use in the replica code.
